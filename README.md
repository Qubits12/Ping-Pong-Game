#Ping-pong-game

Create-a-game-screen
A Ping pong game is a single-player game. Here, the player controls a paddle at the bottom of the screen and uses it to hit a ball that moves around the game screen. The player scores a point each time the paddle hits the ball. The game ends when the ball falls off the bottom of the screen. 
In this unit, you will collaborate to create a ping-pong game. This project will not only teach you about game creation but also about collaboration platforms like GitHub.

The project will be divided into multiple parts, beginning with the planning phase, in which you will define the game's needs. This will be followed by the development phase, during which you will be responsible for the game's design and coding. 

You will use GitHub throughout the project as a collaboration and version control tool. You will discover how to utilize it to manage your code, collaborate with other team members, and monitor the project's development.

##Identify the requirements
A software requirement document (SRD) defines the specific requirements and specifications for a software system. It includes a precise explanation of what the program should be able to accomplish, how it should act, and what it should look like. The SRD is a crucial document utilized throughout the software development lifecycle, from early planning through final testing and deployment.

Let’s create a requirements document for the Ping Pong Game

####Objective of the game.
The game's objective is to hit the ball using a paddle and prevent it from falling off the screen bottom.
The player loses if the ball misses the paddle and hits the bottom of the screen. 

####Game plan
Using the arrow keys, the player controls a paddle at the bottom of the screen.
The ball is fired from the paddle and bounces off the walls.
The speed of the ball gradually increases as the game progresses.
When the ball falls over the bottom of the screen, the player loses.

####Game elements
The player uses a paddle to hit a ball.

####User Interface
The player's score and the highest score will be displayed on the top screen.
The game will have a straightforward and easy user interface.
There will be a welcome message, and then the game will start.
Finally, a game-over message and the final score will be displayed. 

####Technical Requirements
Python will be used to develop the game.
The game will make use of the Turtle library.
The game is compatible with Windows, Mac, and Linux.
The game's screen size is 600px X 500px.

####Timeline:
The game creation process will take around four weeks.
The game will undergo two weeks of beta testing prior to release.
