# Ping-pong-game
A Ping pong game is a single-player game. Here, the player controls a paddle at the bottom of the screen and uses it to hit a ball that moves around the game screen. The player scores a point each time the paddle hits the ball. The game ends when the ball falls off the bottom of the screen.
